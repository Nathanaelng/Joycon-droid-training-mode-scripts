# JOYCON DROID TRAINING MODE SCRIPTS

These are scripts for the Tas UI feature in Joycon droid that can be downloaded from the Play Store.

Things to note when using the scripts.

-When using scripts to make the cpu DI they will sometimes mix in no DI.

-Landing aerials arent done close enough to the ground where they are the safest due to latency issues with the app.

-If you are practicing parrys, the  cpu will stop and try to jab straight afterward usually.

-If there are any issues with the script you can usually just reset training mode and then just wait for a few runs of the script.

App is still in alpha so if you want to write something that is smaller than a 5 frame window, then it most likely wont be possible as of now.

If you have any issues you can DM me on twitter or even better you can join joycon droids discord server ask questions here https://discord.gg/xsHHsh3
