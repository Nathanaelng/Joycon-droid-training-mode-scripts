# Landing-fh-aerial-scripts

These are scripts for the Tas UI feature in Joycon droid that can be downloaded from the Play Store.

Landing aerials arent done close enough to the ground where they are the safest due to latency issues with the app.

If you are practicing parrys, the  cpu will stop and try to jab straight afterwards. 

If there are any issues with the script you can usually just reset training mode and then just wait for a few runs of the script.
